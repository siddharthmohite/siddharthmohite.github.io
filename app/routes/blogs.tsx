                        {`
from datetime import datetime
class Foo:
    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int):
    self.name = name

                        The issue was that the created attribute was assigned at the moment the class instance was created, not dynamically at request time. Since we were deploying our backend on Azure, every time a long-lived instance of this class persisted, it retained an outdated timestamp instead of generating a new one per request. This led to inconsistencies in our application.
                    </span>
                    <h2 className="heading">Solution</h2>
                    <span className="content">
                        To fix this, we ensured that the datetime value was assigned at request time rather than when the class instance was initialized. One approach was moving the datetime assignment logic outside of the class and into the API routing level.
                        Here's the corrected approach:
                    </span>
                    <pre>
                    <code>
                        {`
from datetime import datetime
    def create_foo(name: str, age: int):
        return {
            "name": name,
            "age": age,
            "created": datetime.now()
    }`}
                    </code>
                    </pre>
                    <span className="content">
                    Now, every time a request is made, a fresh timestamp is generated instead of relying on a timestamp set at the time of class instantiation.
Alternatively, if we wanted to stick with the class-based approach but ensure a fresh timestamp, we could do this:
                    </span>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            {`
class Foo:
    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.created = datetime.now()

    @classmethod
    def create(cls, name: str, age: int):
        return cls(name, age)`}
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <span className="content">
                    This ensures that the timestamp is correctly assigned each time a new instance is explicitly created.
                        </span>   
                </div>    
        </div>
))}
        </div>    
    );
