## Introduction  

I always wanted to build some type of cool portfolio website for myself. One day just got this random idea and in january 2025 I started to build this from scratch. It was fun to make and also a lot of learnings. Hope you like it!

I will try to fork this repo and make the content editable from a single file so if other people want to use it as their portofolio website.

So I added a bunch of features. But few other ones are still left out. Here is the list that I will try to finish:
1. Chrome
2. Trash
3. Calculator
4. Spotlight Search(Actual Functionality and search)
5. Stage Manager(Tough one to build)
6. Right Sidebar on Homepage when you click the Date(Shows)

    d.News
    e.Stock Market info
