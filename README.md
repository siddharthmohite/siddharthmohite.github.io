## Introduction  

I always wanted to build some type of cool portfolio website for myself. One day just got this random idea and in january 2025 I started to build this from scratch. It was fun to make and also a lot of learnings. Hope you like it!

I will try to fork this repo and make the content editable from a single file so if other people want to use it as their portofolio website.
